This project is for our first session which is basically to set up rails and create a project called Booking_System to test our understanding.

Booking_System includes: 

1 - scaffold for ticket model with the following date:
      name: string
      refrence: integer
      price: float
      
2 - we have created two branches
     * The main branch.
     * The f branch which for development

3 - I have created a pull request for merging f branch with the main.


as we have said this project is just for getting started with ruby on rails and git flow
